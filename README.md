# Cross-Domain Link Prediction using Heterogeneous GNNs

A graph-based machine learning system that predicts potential connections between **Twitter users** and **GitHub repositories**, such as whether a user is likely to **star** a repository. Built using **Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, the project showcases the potential of **cross-platform recommendation systems** through intelligent graph modeling and link prediction.

## Features

- Cross-Platform Modeling: Combines data from **Twitter** and **GitHub** to create a unified graph structure.
- Heterogeneous Graph: Represents multiple types of nodes (users, repositories, hashtags, tweets) and edges (stars, posts, tags, follows).
- Graph Neural Networks: Utilizes **Heterogeneous GNN models** like **HAN (Heterogeneous Attention Network)** and **HGT (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer)**.
- Link Prediction: Predicts whether a **Twitter user** will interact with (e.g., star) a **GitHub repository**.
- Real-World Application: Demonstrates a novel use case for **cross-domain recommendation systems** in social-coding platforms.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Twitter data: User interactions, tweets, hashtags  
   - GitHub data: Repositories, stars, contributors  

2. **Graph Construction**  
   - Nodes: Twitter users, tweets, hashtags, GitHub repositories  
   - Edges: Tweet-posts, hashtags-used, repo-starred, user-follows  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train a heterogeneous GNN (e.g., HAN or HGT) to learn node embeddings  
   - Perform link prediction between user and repo nodes  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like AUC, F1-score, Precision, and Recall
